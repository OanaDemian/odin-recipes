    <h1>White Russian</h1>
    <img src="../images/big-lebowski-stir.gif" alt="The Dude, looking puzzled, is holding a white russian next to a drinks cabinet.">
    <p>The White Russian came about in the '60s when someone added a bit of cream to the Black
       Russian, rendering it white. Neither drink is Russian in origin, but the name refers to
        the vodka, a spirit often associated with Russia.</p>
    <p>The White Russian suffered a bit from a stodgy, antiquated reputation until the 1998 movie 
      “The Big Lebowski” came along and breathed new life into the cocktail with Jeff Bridges'
      character, the Dude, sipping it exclusively—and constantly. It's one of popular culture's 
      best drinks-related successes. Of course, if you want to order it like the Dude, throw in 
      the occasional call for a “Caucasian.” The barkeep will know what you mean.</p>
