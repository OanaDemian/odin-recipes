    <h2> James Bond's cocktail of choice </h2>
    <p>The Dry Vodka Martini is surely James Bond's most famous cocktail of choice and is 
      the drink which brought the phrase "shaken and not stirred" to public notoriety. It remains 
      a classic cocktail and is now as popular as the Gin Martini that it originally evolved from.</p>
